#prigram that finds the area of a rectangle
###########################
width = int(input("Please enter width: "))
height = int(input("Please enter height: "))
print("The area is:", width * height)
#Completed successfully? Yes
#I did not encounter any errors
#I solved it by seperating the string and int. w/ a comma
#and just mult. the width variable by the height variable
#I did not find anything difficult
